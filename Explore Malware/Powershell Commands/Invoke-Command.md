**Distinguishing Use from Misuse**
- A system admin using `Invoke-Command` to check disk space on all servers? _Normal._  
- A random non-admin account running encoded base64 payloads using `Invoke-Command` at 2 AM targeting multiple machines? _Red flag! Alert the SOC!_

**How Do Security Tools See it?**
- **EDR/SIEM platforms** may flag `Invoke-Command` if it’s run by unusual accounts, runs suspicious scripts, or is used in odd patterns.
- **Detection logic** is often about “how” and “by whom,” not just “what.”
