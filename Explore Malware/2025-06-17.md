Day one of understanding PowerShell through malicious intent.
The play is simple:
- Daily research attack methods that utilize fileless malware.
- Understand the way its pulled into the logs.
- Research obfuscation methods.
- Commands that might be used to mask attackers actions.
- Create an environment where I can test it if possible.

Today I researched Cobalt Strike and Emotet.

I am also becoming more familiar on how to use obsidian.
